# Finding-States

Technologies/Concepts Used: Python, Pandas, Turtle, GUI, OOP, Working with CSV Data

1. An educational game that requires users to input the 50 states which is then written on US map.
2. Pandas library is used to read the csv file as DataFrame and perform various functions such as creating a list, checking if the user entered the correct state, and reading the correct state coordinates and mapping its name onto the screen.
3. Graphical User Interface (GUI) is provided using the turtle module.
4. User can end the game using the keyword "Exit", which then creates a new CSV file containing a list of states that were not entered.
